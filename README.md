<p>The assigment was to recreate the Google Homepage. (the simple one with just a search box).</p>

<p>Points to remember:</p>
<ul>
    <li>DON’T BE A PERFECTIONIST! You’re just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn’t have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png">Here’s a link to the Google Logo just in case they temporarily replace it with a Doodle!</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/">Here’s a cached page of the Google home page for reference in case the original logo is not there</a></li>
